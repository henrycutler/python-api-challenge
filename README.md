Final challenges are in the starter_code folder. 

Observations from WeatherPy:
  1. Temperatures rise as latitudes approact 0, and then fall the further they are from 0
  2. Wind speeds, humidity and cloudiness all have relatively low correlations to latitude, both in the northern and southern hemishperes. 
  3. It is even more apparent that temperatures rise as latitudes approach zero, as recorded in the latidude vs temperature charts in the northern and southern hemishphere.
